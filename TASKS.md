## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now. 
***
With the data given, we have seen the historical evaluation of managers, engenieers and operators we have written the needed matrices D and M. At the same time, although it is said that we were all managers, we have performed the operations assuming that there are 2 managers, 1 engineer and 1 operator. After writting it down in Repl.it we can affirm that the predicted number of employees that our company is going to have next year is 1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators.

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***
The need for employees is predicted to be 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators.So, as the foremer prediction of the number of employees which was going to be 1 manager, 1 engineer and 2 operators, it is dected some mistmatches: there is a shortage of 3 managers, a shortage of 10 engenieers and a shortage of 5 operators.
Thus, in order to solve this problem, we would have to do some upsizing strategies such as hiring more people, increasing the worktime, and increasing overtime.
